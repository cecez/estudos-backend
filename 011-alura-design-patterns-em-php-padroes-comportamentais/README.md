# Design Patterns (behaviour)
## Strategy
- Many algorithms have a similar behavior, but they have different implementations.
- Changing conditionals with classes, decreasing complexity.

## Chain of Responsibility
- A chain of responsibility is a way to link a series of objects and give them the ability to handle a request.

## State
- useful when an object can have many behaviours, dependant from its state.

## Command
- constructor (dependencies) and execution in the same class.

## Command Handler (Use cases, Application services)
- separation between command (data) from execution (handler and its dependencies)
- orchestrate tasks to be executed

## Observer
- pub/sub
