# Design Patterns (behaviour)
## Strategy
- Many algorithms have a similar behavior, but they have different implementations.
- Changing conditionals with classes, decreasing complexity.

## Chain of Responsibility
- A chain of responsibility is a way to link a series of objects and give them the ability to handle a request.

## State
- useful when an object can have many behaviours, dependant from its state.
